# Pulling Molecules

![author interacting making pinch gesture](pinchgesture.png)

"Pulling Molecules" is a generative art project that explores the dynamic interactions within a particle system through the lens of creative coding. This project leverages webcam input and a preloaded sound composition to offer an immersive visual and auditory experience, simulating the behavior of molecules in an engaging and interactive manner.

## Concept

Drawing inspiration from the natural motion and interaction of molecules in a fluid medium, "Pulling Molecules" uses real-time webcam input to allow users to influence the motion and formation of particles on their screen. This digital canvas becomes a playground where molecular dynamics are no longer abstract concepts, but vivid, interactive experiences, enhanced by a captivating sound composition.

## Features

- **Interactive Particle System**: A lively particle system that reacts to the user's hand movements via webcam input, mimicking the attractive and repulsive forces observed in molecular interactions.
- **Formation Mode**: Temporarily structures particles around the user's hand position when joining index and thumb (pinch gesture), illustrating the fluid and organized nature of molecular behavior.
- **Preloaded Sound Composition**: A preloaded musical composition that enriches the visual experience, adding depth and immersion to the interaction.
- **Webcam Input**: Utilizes the webcam to create a direct interaction channel, allowing users to dynamically influence the particle system with their movements/gestures.
- **Responsive Design**: The project's responsive design ensures a seamless experience across a variety of devices and screen sizes.

## Live Demo

Experience "Pulling Molecules" firsthand and dive into an interactive environment where your movements shape the visual narrative. Visit the live application [here](https://marlonbarrios.github.io/pulling-molecules/).

## Setup and Usage

### Pre-requisites

- A modern web browser with support for JavaScript.
- A functioning webcam for the full interactive experience.

### Running the Project

1. Navigate to the [live demo](https://marlonbarrios.github.io/pulling-molecules/) in your web browser.
2. Allow the application to access your webcam when prompted to enable the interactive features.
3. Influence the particle system with your hand movements. Form a pinch motion to activate the formation mode, drawing particles to your hand's location.
4. Press 'P' to play or pause the background music, further enhancing your experience with the visual elements.

## Development

Built using p5.js for both rendering and sound playback, and leveraging MediaPipe for sophisticated hand tracking via the webcam, "Pulling Molecules" is a testament to the power of integrating cutting-edge technologies to create deeply engaging and interactive art.
